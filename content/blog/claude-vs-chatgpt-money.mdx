## Pro Tips: Getting the Most Out of Each Tool

### ChatGPT Power User Tips

1. **Use Custom Instructions**: Set your profession, writing style, and preferences once — every conversation benefits.
2. **Build Custom GPTs for recurring tasks**: If you write the same type of content regularly, a Custom GPT with your templates and guidelines saves massive time.
3. **Chain Code Interpreter with writing**: Upload data → analyze → generate a written report with charts. All in one conversation.
4. **Use the mobile app for voice**: Dictate ideas, brainstorm while walking, get quick answers — the voice mode is surprisingly useful for productivity.
5. **Save and organize conversations**: Use descriptive titles. Old conversations with good prompts become your personal template library.

### Claude Power User Tips

1. **Use Projects religiously**: Create a Project for each client or content type. Upload their brand guidelines, past content, and style preferences. Every conversation within that Project automatically has this context.
2. **Take advantage of the context window**: Don't summarize long documents — paste them in full. Claude handles 200K tokens, which is roughly a full novel. This is game-changing for document analysis.
3. **Use extended thinking for complex tasks**: When you need Claude to really think through a strategy or analysis, the extended thinking feature produces noticeably better output.
4. **Write detailed system prompts**: Claude responds particularly well to detailed instructions about format, tone, and structure. Invest 5 minutes in a good prompt and save hours in editing.
5. **Iterate within conversations**: Claude maintains context well within long conversations. Instead of starting new chats, build on previous responses for increasingly refined output.

### The Workflow That Makes the Most Money

Here's the workflow I've found generates the highest-quality, highest-value output:

1. **Research with ChatGPT** (web browsing + data analysis)
2. **Outline with Claude** (superior structural thinking)
3. **Draft with Claude** (better writing quality)
4. **Generate visuals with ChatGPT** (DALL-E integration)
5. **Final review with Claude** (catches issues, improves clarity)

This produces consistently better results than using either tool alone, and the quality difference translates directly into what you can charge clients.
